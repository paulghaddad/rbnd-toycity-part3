1. How long did you spend working on this project?

I spent approximately 5-6 hours on this project.

2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?

Really making me think about writing code in an object-oriented fashion. I
completed the project from start to finish using TDD, so that was pretty
rewarding.

3. What two additional features did you build? Why?

Feature 1: The ability to return a product
Feature 2: Check to see if the customer purchased enough of the product to allow
a return to occur.

4. Where do you still have room to grow?

I definitely feel that I did a good job creating the Customer and Product
classes using good Object-Oriented Programming, I feel the Transaction class can
be improved. Not only is it too long (over 100 lines), but it has many
responsibilities. This is the spot where I'm really working at improving my OO
design skills. I made a lot of progress in this exercise (it was great for
that!), but want to continue projects to improve in this area.
